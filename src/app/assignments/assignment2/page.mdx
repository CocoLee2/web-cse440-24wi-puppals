# Assignment 2: Getting the Right Design

<UnderDevelopment display={true} />

## Overview

Even when a problem is well-motivated, understanding that problem and choosing a design to pursue is a difficult process.
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design through
__design research__, __task development__, __generating multiple potential designs__, and finally __selecting a design__ to pursue.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of eight milestones.

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 2A
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment2a}>

The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.

Generate 5 to 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:

- Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts in the environment).
- Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.
- Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.
- Features: a specific capability a design might have.
- Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a design might engage or support.

We will provide large sheets of paper. Divide a large sheet of paper into 32 squares, each approximately 2in by 2in.
Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea.
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.

The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
You may include ideas from existing products, but no two ideas should be alike.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.

After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
Your project will soon need to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas in these directions.
Following up on the above, additionally brainstorm:

- People: types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and opportunities.
- Focus: what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus on learning more about.
- Method: how you might engage those people to learn more about problems and opportunities.

#### Submission and Grading

There is no submission for this milestone.

  * ASSIGNMENT 2B

  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment2b}>

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research,
encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that research
and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.

As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research
(e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations)
to learn from at least __three__ people who might use your design.

In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design and other stakeholders to consider in your design.
Among potential stakeholders, describe the __participants__ you plan to pursue,
including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices.
Give enough information to convince us that you can actually find and engage with your target participants in the next week.

- For example, your target participants should not be "doctors" but instead a specific group of doctors
  (e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic).
  If gaining access to the target participants is non-trivial (e.g., as with busy doctors),
  describe the steps you have already taken to gain access and your plans to recover if you are unable to gain access.
  Indicate when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.

In another paragraph, describe the __specific design research methods__
you will use to engage with and learn from these people.
A typical expected method would be contextual inquiry with three participants.
However,  we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design research methods according to your needs.
Please be as specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to observe and your planned focus.
- If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.
- If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask participants to bring or collect.

On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method. For example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to observe,
  what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity,
  and any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your observations.
- If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking points.
- If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask participants to diary.

#### In Class

Be prepared to discuss your design research plan.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Overall Feasibility and Specificity of People__: (3 points)
2. __Overall Feasibility and Specificity of Design Methods__: (3 points)
3. __Primary Method Details__: (2 points)
4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

{/*

  * ASSIGNMENT 2C
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone assignment={calendarData.assignments.assignment2c}>

The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research,
reflect on what you observe and learn,
then update your plans for additional design research.

Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
but also about effectively conducting your design research.

Describe your first design research participant and your findings:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **six** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete.
For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.

Then discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research.
We fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved.

- Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?
- What are your plans for the remaining participants?
- How do you plan to change your design research plan based on what you learned with your first participant?
