## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: cel,
        alt: "A picture of a check engine light on a car dashboard."
    }}
    caption={
        "Depicts a check engine light which tells a car owner that something is amiss with their car maintenance"

Cars are a part of many people's everyday lives and should be well-maintained to 
keep us safe. However, many car owners know little to none about how they should 
upkeep their cars. Because of this, they must rely on repair shops to tell them what 
services they need to get done, often leading them to be upsold on unnecessary services. 
Experiences such as those can lead to financial strain and eventually contribute to the negligence of vehicle maintenance as trust between the car owner and mechanic wanes. 

Our design aims to rebuild that trust and give car owners more control over their car 
maintenance by giving them an easy way to track needed services and service history 
while filling in education gaps about such services.


</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

To gain a better understanding of consumers's wants in a maintenance-tracking app 
our team interviewed an assortment of both potential users and stakeholders.

We conducted three interviews with:
<ol>
  <li>
  a college student who regularly drives his car a few times a week. 
  He finds himself at the mechanic often due to his car being old. He does not have any
  knowledge about car maintenance.
  </li>
  <li>
  another college student who drives his car daily. He considers himself knowledgeable 
  about cars and does a lot of maintenance at home as he does not want to rely on 
  trusting repair shops.
  </li>
  <li>
  a person who drives a couple of hundred miles a week and follows the maintenance schedule 
  from his vehicle's manual. He has a strong distrust of maintenance shops.
  </li>
</ol>

### Need for Transparency

All three of our interviewees expressed distrust in repair shops, two of which mentioned 
that though they distrust them, they have little choice but to use them. This is because 
the only other option is learning how to maintain their car themself. Through our interviews 
it was expressed that the lack of trust stemmed from the fact that the repair shops have 
all the power in the situation to play up the severity of a service needed or to simply add 
a service that is unnecessary or repetitive unbeknownst to the car owner. Because of this, 
we noticed a trend that car owners want more transparency in regard to their car service 
history when dealing with repair shops.


### A Want to Understand

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: info,
            alt: "The AutoPilot apps function to reveal information about a service.",
            caption: "The AutoPilot app lets users see information regarding services.",
        },
        {
            src: receipt,
            alt: "A picture of a recipt with verry expensive charges.",
            caption: "Service costs add up very fast.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>

Our research revealed a want from car owners to be able to understand what services they need for 
their cars and why. It is easy to see that a light is flashing on the dashboard, thus indicating 
a need for a service, but without research on their own, they do not know what it means. This goes 
for services listed at the repair shop as well. A mechanic tells the owner what services they need, 
they sometimes explain what exactly that means in terms of what physically needs to be done, but 
rarely without prompting explain why this service must take place. Understanding why a service needs 
to take place would greatly ease the worries of car owners and build trust between them and mechanics 
according to our interviewees.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Classification For Services Importance

When comparing which services are urgent and which can wait, a novice in car maintenance would not 
know how they stack up against each other. Through our research, the recurring theme of wanting to 
know how to prioritize services kept reappearing. The interviewees shared that a lot of time, they need 
to decline services because of finances and would love to know which to prioritize without sacrificing 
car safety.
